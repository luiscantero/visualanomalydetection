The following YouTube video demonstrates that it is possible to use a camera to predict malfunctions in a factory or machine without having the need to attach vibration sensors:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEoc0YoALt0  The purpose of this project is to create a PoC to test the feasibility of having a simple Raspberry PI with an embedded camera watch over a toy factory setup and detect vibrations invisible to the naked eye.  The solution should take several pictures per second and a diff algorithm will calculate pixel differences between the adjacent pictures. The diff value and a timestamp will then be sent to the Azure Anomaly Detector. The detector should be able to visualize or trigger an alarm when an anomaly is found.
